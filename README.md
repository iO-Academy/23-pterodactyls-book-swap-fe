# React Book Swap App

## Demo

A hosted demo of this repository can be experimented with [here](https://2023-ptero-bookswap-fe.dev.io-academy.uk/)

## Description

Our group was tasked with creating a react web page for a book store with various tasks to complete in a one week period.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
